# ECE16_Final

Code coming soon... 

If you want to get started early, look at https://wiki.python.org/moin/UdpCommunication 
since we will be talking to the game via UDP, locally.

The game code will be based on https://github.com/codingchili/py-race

Do not modify the main code, create your own ```controller.py``` file
